Functions are the same as in C, from what i understood.

```
type_of_return name(type parameter, type other_parameter) {
	do;
	return; (if not void)
}
```

Functions have many things regarding arrays and pointers passed. When you pass arguments, you are basically passing pointers, not values/objects, unless specified.
