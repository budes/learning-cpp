I wanna learn C++, it's very used in competitive programming and it is better than C to code in. It's kinda easier to build many things, than in C.

I will use [this](https://www.learn-cpp.org/) as source to learn C++.

Also, i know mostly of C++ is related to C, so if i see something that is really alike to C, i will just summarize it to the extreme, as i did study it already with C.
